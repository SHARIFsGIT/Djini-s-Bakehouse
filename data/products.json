These moist, tender muffins are loaded with plump, juicy blueberries and topped with a crunchy cinnamon streusel. We use plant-based milk, coconut oil, and flax seeds to create a perfectly tender crumb that's as delicious as traditional muffins. These vegan treats are perfect for breakfast on the go, a midday snack, or anytime you need a sweet pick-me-up.",
